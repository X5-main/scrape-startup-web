# PostQode Integration

AVELIN API is compatible with PostQode — AI-powered SDLC platform with specialized agents for API, Web, and Mobile testing, plus a generic development agent.

PostQode is a full Software Development Lifecycle platform powered by AI, but what sets it apart is its purpose-built testing agents. Rather than one generic QA bot, PostQode ships specialized agents for API testing, Web testing, and Mobile testing — each trained to understand the unique patterns, edge cases, and failure modes of its domain. The API agent understands REST/GraphQL contracts, the Web agent navigates DOM and browser behaviors, and the Mobile agent handles platform-specific quirks.

Ideal for QA teams, DevOps engineers, and development shops that want to automate testing across their entire stack without maintaining brittle test scripts. Pair with AVELIN's agentic models for reliable multi-step test generation and execution.

> **Why AVELIN + PostQode?** Leverage AVELIN's frontier models with 1M-token context windows, automatic failover, and competitive pricing for automation workflows.

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get your AVELIN API key

Sign up at [avelin.ai](https://avelin.ai) and generate an API key. It will look like `sk-ave...xxxx`.

### Step 2: Configure AVELIN

Most automation tools support OpenAI-compatible endpoints via environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.avelin.ai/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=*** API Reference

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| **OpenAI-compatible** | `https://api.avelin.ai/v1` |
| **Anthropic-compatible** | `https://api.avelin.ai` |

## Recommended Models

| Use case | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Complex automation | `avelin-agentic-ultra` | Top-tier reasoning for multi-step workflows |
| Standard tasks | `avelin-agentic-pro` | Balanced performance and cost |
| High-volume simple tasks | `avelin-agentic-fast` | Lowest cost, fastest response |
| Code-heavy automation | `avelin-coding-pro` | 1M context, code understanding |
| Research workflows | `avelin-ultra` | Flagship reasoning capabilities |

## Why AVELIN for PostQode?

- **Agentic models**: Purpose-built for tool-calling and multi-step planning
- **Automatic failover**: Automation keeps running if a provider is down
- **1M context**: Track complex workflows without losing context
- **Cost optimization**: Prompt caching reduces costs by ~80% on repeated prompts

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| **API key error** | Verify `OPENAI_API_BASE` includes `/v1` |
| **Agent loops** | Lower temperature to 0.0-0.1, use `avelin-agentic-ultra` |
| **Token limit** | Break workflow into smaller steps |
| **Tool failures** | Use `avelin-agentic-ultra` for best tool-calling reliability |

# Agent Zero Integration

AVELIN API is compatible with Agent Zero — A platform to build autonomous AI agents effortlessly, with support for multi-step reasoning and tool use.

Agent Zero is a visual agent builder that lets you create autonomous AI agents without writing code. Its killer feature is the drag-and-drop interface for multi-step reasoning chains with built-in tool use — you wire together prompts, APIs, and logic flows visually, and Agent Zero handles the orchestration. Unlike code-first frameworks, it lowers the barrier to entry for non-developers who want production-grade autonomous agents.

Built for operations teams, product managers, and citizen developers who need automation without engineering overhead, Agent Zero turns complex workflows into visual pipelines. Point it at AVELIN's agentic models for reliable tool-calling and multi-step planning out of the box.

> **Why AVELIN + Agent Zero?** Leverage AVELIN's frontier models with 1M-token context windows, automatic failover, and competitive pricing for automation workflows.

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get your AVELIN API key

Sign up at [avelin.ai](https://avelin.ai) and generate an API key. It will look like `sk-ave...xxxx`.

### Step 2: Configure AVELIN

Most automation tools support OpenAI-compatible endpoints via environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.avelin.ai/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=*** API Reference

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| **OpenAI-compatible** | `https://api.avelin.ai/v1` |
| **Anthropic-compatible** | `https://api.avelin.ai` |

## Recommended Models

| Use case | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Complex automation | `avelin-agentic-ultra` | Top-tier reasoning for multi-step workflows |
| Standard tasks | `avelin-agentic-pro` | Balanced performance and cost |
| High-volume simple tasks | `avelin-agentic-fast` | Lowest cost, fastest response |
| Code-heavy automation | `avelin-coding-pro` | 1M context, code understanding |
| Research workflows | `avelin-ultra` | Flagship reasoning capabilities |

## Why AVELIN for Agent Zero?

- **Agentic models**: Purpose-built for tool-calling and multi-step planning
- **Automatic failover**: Automation keeps running if a provider is down
- **1M context**: Track complex workflows without losing context
- **Cost optimization**: Prompt caching reduces costs by ~80% on repeated prompts

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| **API key error** | Verify `OPENAI_API_BASE` includes `/v1` |
| **Agent loops** | Lower temperature to 0.0-0.1, use `avelin-agentic-ultra` |
| **Token limit** | Break workflow into smaller steps |
| **Tool failures** | Use `avelin-agentic-ultra` for best tool-calling reliability |
